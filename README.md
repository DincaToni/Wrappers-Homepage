# Wrappers-Homepage

This was one of my first projects. It's a simple landing homepage created exclusively with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. The images I've used are free stock images and the page design & icons are completely made by me. *The company and all the persons in the "Team" section are completely fictional*.

This project's main purpose is to point out that I have the knowledge and enough experience to work with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
*The page is fully responsive, but it is not optimized for phone or tablet. You can see how I proceeded to optimize other projects.*

**Hope you have a nice day! ;)**
